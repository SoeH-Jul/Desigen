We don't just design our products, we hand make each one ourselves. Just because you buy a \"designer\" piece elsewhere, that doesn't mean it wasn't mass-produced by the hundreds, or even thousands. With Kalmanson Creations, you get a one-of-a-kind look. Each piece is unique. Even when we do a small run of the same design--5 or 6 individual pieces maximum--we vary the design slightly between each one, either in color, or bead selection, or within the loops and swirls of the wire itself.\nLife on the water brings moments of incredible beauty--and incredible fragility. Capture that balance in your accessory style with our nature-inspired designs."}, {"type": "link-button", "position": [451, 512, 122, 43], "text": "SHOP NOW"}, {"type": "background", "position": [0, 0, 1024, 610], "text": ""}]}
