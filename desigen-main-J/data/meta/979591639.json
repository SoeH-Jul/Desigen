These beds can cause behavioural issues, skin irritation and respiration problems. This is due to the harmful chemicals used in the production of memory foam beds. Some of the chemicals include chlorofluorocarbons, trichlorofluoromethane and formaldehyde. These can affect your dog's health and behaviour.\nThis is why WoolyWoofers dog beds are made with 100% British sheep wool to provide your dog with the healthiest sleeeping environment."}, {"type": "link-button", "position": [459, 800, 106, 50], "text": "SHOP"}, {"type": "background", "position": [0, 0, 1024, 1150], "text": ""}]}
