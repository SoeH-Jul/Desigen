He had a great many passions, but his one true constant was his beloved boat, Pilar. She was the esteemed vessel of his endeavors allowing America\u2019s literary giant to reach beyond the shoreline and collect tales each more epic than the last. Papa\u2019s Pilar is crafted for those who live their life with this kind of intention. Always a pioneer and pathfinder \u2014 NEVER A SPECTATOR."}]}
