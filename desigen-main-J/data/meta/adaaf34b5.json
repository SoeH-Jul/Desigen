There comes a time in our lives when we must rise above our current circumstances. We begin to seek a different way, a better way. We talk with those that have experience with what we struggle with. We begin to read books, watch videos, take notes, and most importantly- apply. The path of changing one's life is different for each individual.\nThe process is personal. 24NMW simply offers an attitude to live by.\nWe have come to the conclusion that change often happens slowly over a period of time- each and every day. We commit to a new way of life. Some days are better than others, and many times we must recommit to our goals and desires.\nBut, one thing is for certain. We shall not give up. We will not fall back on our old ways. We will strive. Ever if we struggle...We will push forward.\nEVERY DAY. NO MATTER WHAT!\nMikey B. 24NMW"}, {"type": "background", "position": [0, 0, 1024, 698], "text": ""}]}
